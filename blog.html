      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Balancing school and work has always been a challenge, but it has also shaped me into a more responsible and focused individual. 
        My work experience as a janitor has taught me valuable life lessons that no classroom could ever fully provide.
      </p>

      <h3>My Work Experience</h3>
      <p>
        As a janitor at the University of the Cordilleras, I began my journey by handling basic cleaning duties — sweeping floors, emptying trash bins, 
        and sanitizing rooms. I arrived early every day to make sure that the campus was a clean and safe environment for students and staff alike.
      </p>
      <p>
        I took pride in what I did, even when it was physically exhausting. While mopping floors or dusting desks, I found quiet moments of reflection. 
        Each task reminded me of the importance of humility, discipline, and perseverance.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were days when I felt tired or overwhelmed — balancing exams, lectures, and an 8-hour shift wasn't easy. 
        But through it all, I never lost sight of my goals. My job gave me perspective, built my character, and helped me value every peso I earned.
      </p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Working as a janitor while pursuing my degree in Criminology is not something I’m ashamed of — in fact, I’m proud of it. 
        It taught me resilience, gave me purpose, and built my work ethic. I learned how to manage time, communicate with others, and take responsibility. 
        I hope my story reminds other students that no job is too small and every effort counts. 
        If you are working and studying, know this: you are strong, and your dedication will pay off.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep pushing forward, even if it feels tough. Because every step you take, no matter how hard, is a step closer to your dreams.
